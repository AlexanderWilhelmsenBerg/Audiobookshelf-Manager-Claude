/**
 * PRODUCT_SPEC PLAY-001 — the one player and the one media session, both owned by this service.
 *
 * ### One session, structurally
 *
 * PLAY-001 says "a single media session". That is not enforced by a comment: the [ExoPlayer] and the
 * [MediaLibraryService.MediaLibrarySession] are private to this class, this class is the only `Service`
 * in the module, and the module is the only one in the build that can name either type. Nothing else in
 * the app is able to construct a second one.
 *
 * ### What is not here yet
 *
 * No browse tree — Android Auto and Wear reach a [MediaLibraryService] through `onGetLibraryRoot`, and
 * the default rejects it. That is the honest answer for wave 1 rather than a stub returning an empty
 * root, which would look supported and browse to nothing.
